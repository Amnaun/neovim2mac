I built upon LazyVim by adding plugins I needed, such as avante , competitest , and codesnap , and customized the configuration according to my preferences. During the setup of these plugins, I encountered numerous errors. However, through extensive research and the assistance of my friend ysl2 , I successfully completed my nvim configuration. Of course, this is only the beginningâ€”I will continue to refine and improve my nvim setup.
